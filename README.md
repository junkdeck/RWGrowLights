# LED Growlights

Simple mod for adding energy efficient LED grow lights for growing crops indoors. Requires research to build.

Since they use a lot less power (Sun Lamp equivalent uses 1200W), the bigger lights require components. Small lights use more power than the Sun Lamp to cover same area, but are still useful if you don't require as big of an area.
